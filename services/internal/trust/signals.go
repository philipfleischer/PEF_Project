// Package trust implements the trust algorithm of NIST SP 800-207: a
// continuously updated score in [0, 1] for every subject, computed from
// signals about it. The PDP writes the score into context.trustScore before
// the policy is evaluated, so a rule can say "operating a breaker requires
// trust >= 0.8".
//
// Verification is continuous: the authentication part of the score decays
// with time since the last authentication, and negative signals (an IDS
// alert, a denied request, a compromise verdict) lower it at once. How fast
// and how much is what research question RQ4 evaluates.
//
// The same formula is implemented in C++ in sim/core (M6) and described in
// Docs/architecture/trust-algorithm.md. Change all three together.
//
// Industry equivalents: Google BeyondCorp access levels, Microsoft Entra
// Conditional Access risk, device posture checks in Zscaler and Cloudflare.
