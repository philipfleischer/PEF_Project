// DefaultSubstationPolicy returns the baseline policy for the digital
// substation. It encodes the IEC 62443 zones and the Purdue levels as ABAC
// rules, with least privilege for every kind of subject:
//
//  1. anything from a subject with trust below 0.3 is denied
//  2. an auditor may never do anything but read (separation of duties)
//  3. edge devices (PMUs, meters, IEDs) may write telemetry to their own zone only
//  4. fog services may read telemetry of their own zone
//  5. operating a breaker needs role operator, trust >= 0.8 and a source in
//     the control zones; it is logged and re-verified every 10 s
//  6. in emergency (break-glass) mode an operator may operate a breaker with
//     trust >= 0.5, always logged and alerted
//  7. setpoint changes need role engineer and trust >= 0.7
//  8. an auditor may read telemetry, aggregates, policies and the audit log
//  9. cloud analytics may read aggregated telemetry of all zones
//  10. tasks may be offloaded to fog and cloud nodes, and to edge devices in
//     their own zone, with trust >= 0.5
//  11. services may be migrated by fog and cloud nodes with trust >= 0.7
//  12. policy administration is only for spiffe://*/cloud/admin/* with trust >= 0.8
//
// It returns a new value on every call, so callers may modify it. The same
// rules exist as JSON in deploy/policies/substation.json.
