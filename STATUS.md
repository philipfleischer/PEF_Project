## Components

| Part | Path | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Go services | `services/` | 🟡 | libraries: `model`, `config`, `httpx`, `observability`, `svc`, `trust`, `pdp`; service `ztc-pdp`; CLI `ztcctl` |

## Go packages

| Package | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `internal/model` | ✅ | layers, device classes, access request and decision (fail closed) |
| `internal/policy` | ✅ | ABAC engine, deny-overrides with default deny, lock-free install, default substation policy, strict JSON loading |
| `internal/trust` | ✅ | decaying trust score with hand-computed test vectors, concurrent store with injectable clock |
| `internal/pdp` | ✅ | policy plus trust, PDP-owned time, trust and emergency, HTTP API with write token, remote client, chain, placement, decision cache |
| `internal/config` | ✅ | `ZTC_` env vars, invalid values reported through `Err()` |
| `internal/httpx` | ✅ | strict JSON decoding, server timeouts, graceful shutdown |
| `internal/observability` | ✅ | Prometheus exposition, `/healthz`, `/readyz`, RED metrics, JSON logs |
| `internal/svc` | ✅ | shared start-up: config, logger, metrics, fail-fast serve |
| `cmd/ztc-pdp` | 🟡 | runs; decision API comes in M1 |
